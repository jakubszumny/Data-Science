### Summary:
This project was fundamentally about visualizing data from two primary sources to explore a simple yet intriguing question: Does a person's income in their country of residence influence their video game purchasing behaviors—be it the quantity, type, or price of games they buy? This question stemmed from a shared interest in gaming between myself and my teammate. As enthusiasts deeply embedded in the gaming culture, we’ve often speculated about what drives game sales in various markets and how much local economic factors weigh into this.

Motivated by our passion for gaming and a curiosity about its intersection with economic realities, we embarked on this research to scrutinize the potential correlation between average income levels and video game sales across different countries. We both are avid gamers and just found the concept overall of the factors that lead to someones purchasing of games. I think the coolest aspect as we discovered was just the fact that regardless of price people will continue to purchase games. Which really did show it goes deeper than a price tag in the gaming world.

Our research was driven by a couple of key questions:
1. Is there a discernible link between the income levels in a country and the video game spending habits of its residents?
2. Do people in wealthier nations tend to spend more on video games, or are the trends more complex?
3. What factors if not price contribute to a person purchasing a video game?

To answer these questions, we combined and analyzed datasets covering global video game sales and average incomes by country. Our methodology involved statistical analysis and visualization techniques to map out and understand the patterns in the data. Specifically, we looked at correlation coefficients and created scatter plots to examine the relationship between the economic status of a region and its video game purchase patterns.

Surprisingly, our findings revealed a very slight negative correlation between average income and video game sales, which was contrary to our initial hypothesis that higher income might correlate with greater expenditure on games. This outcome suggests that average income is not a significant predictor of video game spending on a global scale. It implies that other factors, perhaps cultural influences or market saturation, could be more influential in shaping video game sales.

These results open up new questions and possibilities for further research. For instance, it would be valuable to look into how cultural factors or the availability of gaming technology influences game sales more than economic capability. Additionally, examining the impact of demographic variables like age and gaming preferences could yield deeper insights.

Overall, this project not only shed light on the complex dynamics between income and video game purchases but also really helped improve our understanding of global market trends in the gaming industry. It was a fascinating exploration into how economic factors intertwine with entertainment choices, providing a groundwork for further studies in this area.

- **License:** CC BY 4.0 (Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License)
- **Description:** The Average Income by Country dataset from the World Bank is a critical resource for understanding economic conditions globally. It provides detailed annual data on the gross national income per capita for each country, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP). This adjustment is essential for making equitable comparisons between countries with vastly different living costs and economic conditions. The dataset is structured to highlight the economic capability of populations within their respective national contexts, offering a snapshot of economic health and consumer purchasing power. Data spans from recent decades up to the current year, providing a longitudinal view that is crucial for analyzing economic growth, trends, and disparities. The dataset’s availability under the Creative Commons Attribution license allows for extensive use, modification, and sharing, as long as the World Bank is appropriately credited. This facilitates widespread use in academic, policy-making, and economic forecasting contexts.

**Relevance of Datasets to the Project:**
These datasets were chosen for their comprehensive coverage and relevance to our research question regarding the interplay between economic status and video game purchasing behaviors. By correlating video game sales data with average income data, we aim to explore whether higher incomes correlate with increased expenditure on video games, or whether other factors such as cultural preferences and availability play more significant roles. The temporal span of these datasets allows us to examine changes over time and provide insights that are not only current but also reflective of historical market and economic conditions. This longitudinal analysis is crucial for understanding deeper trends and preparing a more robust analytical framework that can potentially forecast future trends in the gaming industry.

The datasets' structured and extensive nature makes them particularly valuable for conducting a detailed statistical analysis. Their open licenses encourage a broad and unrestricted exploration of the data, which is pivotal for academic and commercial research that seeks to understand and predict patterns of consumer behavior in the global gaming market.

### Findings:

Our analysis explored the relationship between average income and video game sales globally, yielding a very slight negative correlation, with a correlation coefficient of -0.000785. This finding indicates a nearly negligible inverse relationship between a country's average income and its video game sales, contrary to our initial hypothesis, which suggested that higher incomes might correlate with greater expenditure on video games.

We employed scatter plots to visualize these findings across various countries, illustrating that, for most, variations in income levels do not correspond to significant changes in video game sales. The plots displayed a dense clustering of points, showing no discernible upward or downward trend as average income levels increased, highlighting the weak relationship between these two variables.

Further breaking down the data, we examined video game sales in both high-income and lower-income countries. In both segments, the correlation remained weak, indicating that higher economic status does not necessarily lead to proportionally higher expenditures on video games. This suggests that other factors, possibly cultural or market-related, might be influencing video game purchases more than income levels.

Our analysis also looked at the distribution of video game sales across income brackets without finding a strong alignment with specific income levels. This non-linear relationship suggests that the propensity to purchase video games is influenced by a complex interplay of factors beyond mere economic capability.

Additionally, we analyzed the global distribution of video game sales relative to income levels through the scatter plots, which revealed interesting patterns. Some regions with moderate to low average incomes, such as parts of Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia, showed robust video game markets. This suggests that factors such as cultural preferences and market saturation might play significant roles in shaping video game sales, rather than direct economic capability.

In conclusion, our findings suggest that the relationship between economic prosperity and discretionary spending on entertainment like video games is not straightforward. This challenges the assumption that higher income directly correlates with increased spending on games and indicates that global video game markets might be more significantly influenced by other factors. These insights offer a new perspective on market dynamics in the gaming industry and suggest that entities looking to understand or predict video game sales should consider a broader array of factors beyond just economic conditions.

Our project highlights the complex dynamics between income and video game purchases and provides a foundation for future studies to explore additional variables that could affect this relationship, such as demographic trends, digital access, and local market strategies.
