    "We plan on continuing to explore simulation in Python this week, however, this time, we're going to simulate some real-world events that have actually happened in the past.  The goal is for you to see how we can use data science to think about issues of equity and social justice.  As usual, in addition to coding, we want you to get practice having discussions about the data science you're doing and think about how data science can be a useful tool that can help you in your future job and as a citizen.\n",

    "# Puzzle 1: Jury Selection and Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The 6th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides the right to an ‚Äúimpartial jury‚Äù in criminal prosecutions, but what exactly does this mean? The Supreme Court has said that juries must be drawn from a representative cross-section of the community. In other words, juries should be randomly selected from the eligible population. However, there are many instances in history where it doesn‚Äôt seem like this was the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take for example, the case of Berghuis v. Smith.  In 1993, Smith (A Black man) was convicted of 2nd-degree murder by an all-white jury and sentenced to life in prison. The jury was selected from a panel of about 100 randomly selected people. Only 3 of them were Black and none of those 3 made it into the final 37 considered for Smith‚Äôs trial. The county population was approximately 8 percent Black at the time of the trial.  Remember, jury panels are supposed to be selected at random from the eligible population.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Puzzle 1.1: Your Initial Thoughts\n",
    "‚ùì **Group Discussion Question** ‚ùì Because 8% of the eligible population was Black, 3 Black people on a panel of 100 might seem low.  Does this difference (8% vs. 3%) seem big to you? Do you think this could be due to chance?\n",
    "\n",

    "Yes, it is a big difference, because 8 percent was eligible but only 3 was chosen. It is possible to be due by chance, but it is actually quite a large difference if you think about it. If 8 percent was eligible I feel like a number such as 5 or 6 percent would make more sense. I think that there was some bias which is why the percentage was so different."

    "This case was appealed and sent to the Supreme Court.  Some people claimed that the overall percentage disparity (Between 8% and 3%) was small and reflected no attempt to include or exclude a specified number of Black people from the jury.\" They claimed this \"small\" difference could simply be due to chance.  Critics and Smith claimed that the system of jury selection caused the lack of fair and reasonable representation of black people on the jury.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Puzzle 1.2: Writing a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs do a simulation in Python to understand what‚Äôs going on.  Write a simulation to show the expected distribution.  Remember, from the case: we're trying to see if the difference between 8% and 3% is small and reflects \"no attempt to include or exclude a specified number of African Americans.\"  In other words, **we want to write a function to randomly sample 100 people from a population that has 8% Black people.**  The function should return the number of Black people in each jury.  We can do this multiple times and see how rare it is to get 3 or fewer people in the jury. Write your function below and then we will do the simulation in Puzzle 1.3."

The resumes that they sent were identical, except they changed the names and email addresses to have either a ‚Äúwhite sounding‚Äù name like Emily or a ‚ÄúBlack sounding‚Äù name like Lakisha, according to the study.  Assuming that a resume has about a 20% chance of getting a call back and half of the resumes had white sounding names and half had Black sounding names, let‚Äôs do this simulation.
